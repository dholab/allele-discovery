# alleled: amplicon-based allele genotyping and discovery

A bioinformatic pipeline that takes long, accurate amplicon reads and uses them to perform genotyping and novel allele discovery. As of 2024, the methods used here perform well with PacBio HiFi reads, as well as Oxford Nanopore reads generated with R10 chemistry and super-accuracy basecalling.
